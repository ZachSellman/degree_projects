Advanced Data Management Project notes:

put all code in the query panel with comments to make going line by line easier

you are making two different tables: a detailed table and summary table

when report talks about detail vs summary they are discussing the two tables

Section A:
Create the business question

Detailed Table:
The detailed table will end up containing every record that is relevant to the question you are asking.
Likely to have tons of rows as it is all of the data!

Summary Table:
Contains the answer to the question you are asking. That should be relatively limited data
